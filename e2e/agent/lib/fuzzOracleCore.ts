/**
 * The undo/redo fuzzer's oracle CORE: the two functions that run in BOTH worlds.
 *
 * Shipping a whole `get_project_state` to Node on every step is the fuzzer's
 * dominant cost (~60 KB on the fractal fixture, ~277 KB on naharon, twice per
 * iteration). So the snapshot is taken and compared INSIDE the webview, and only
 * a verdict plus a small targeting digest crosses the WebDriver bridge.
 *
 * That means the same code has to run in Node (unit tests, and the Node-side
 * diff path) and in the page. It is not duplicated: the functions below are
 * SELF-CONTAINED - no imports, no module-scope references, every helper nested -
 * and `oracleInjectionSource()` serializes them with `Function.prototype
 * .toString()` for injection. tsx/esbuild strips the type annotations and
 * otherwise leaves a plain function declaration, so what the page evaluates is
 * literally the code Node runs. `fuzzOracleCore.test.ts` proves that by feeding
 * the same state to the direct call and to the injected-and-evaled copy and
 * asserting byte-identical output; a stray outer reference would surface there
 * as a ReferenceError, because `new Function` closes over nothing.
 *
 * Do NOT let these two grow a dependency, and do NOT hand-copy them anywhere.
 *
 * ## What the snapshot normalizes, and why so little
 *
 * The fuzzer's claim is "undo/redo roundtrips the project EXACTLY", so the
 * comparison covers the full IPC payload - `project` + `stations` + `stats` +
 * `frozen_shots`. `project` alone is not enough: `ProjectIpc` omits
 * `station_offsets` / `station_comments`, which are only observable through
 * `stations[].coordinates` and `stations[].comment`.
 *
 * Every field dropped is a place a real bug could hide, so the list is short and
 * each entry is a thing that CANNOT match by construction:
 *
 *   - `project.modified_at`  - every undo/redo path calls `Project::touch()`
 *     (`src-tauri/src/core/state/undo.rs`).
 *   - `project.file_path`    - `restore_snapshot_into` carries the LIVE path
 *     across a snapshot restore (`core/state/app_state.rs`).
 *   - `project.next_section_id`, `project.next_closure_id`,
 *     `project.sections.*.next_shot_id` - monotonic id counters, and an
 *     ASYMMETRY rather than a bug: a snapshot-pair undo restores them verbatim
 *     while a targeted undo (`restore_section`, `restore_shot`) only ever raises
 *     them, so comparing them would fire on every mixed history.
 *
 * Everything else is compared: shot uuids, `reverse_parity`, the gauge anchors,
 * `StationMerge.merged_at`, every `LoopClosure` metric, both imported-hash
 * vectors, and all geometry.
 *
 * Two other classes of noise are handled without dropping anything. Object keys
 * are sorted recursively, which canonicalizes `Project::section_offsets` (a
 * `HashMap`, so its JSON key order is not stable across a snapshot restore)
 * without hiding a value. And numbers are rounded to 12 significant digits,
 * because geometry is RE-DERIVED after every undo/redo rather than copied. The
 * rounding is only the fast path: when two canonical strings still disagree,
 * Node re-compares with an absolute tolerance too (see `projectSnapshot.ts`),
 * which is what catches values either side of a true zero.

 *
 * The snapshot comparison only catches drift BETWEEN states. If a forward

 * every snapshot matches and nothing fires. These are the checks that do not
 * care what the previous state was.
 *
 * ## What lives here vs in `check_project_integrity`
 *
 * The app already has a structural-integrity checker
 * (`AppState::integrity_check` -> `Project::check_structural_integrity`,
 * `src-tauri/src/models/project/integrity.rs`). Duplicating it would be noise,
 * so this suite deliberately does NOT re-check what it owns:
 *
 *   - non-finite (NaN/inf) shot geometry
 *   - two shots in ONE section sharing a uuid (note: the app's contract is
 *     per-section, not global - `ensure_unique_shot_uuids` dedupes per section -
 *     so global uniqueness is NOT asserted here either)
 *   - dangling merge / loop-closure / zero-datum refs, orphan station offsets
 *     and comments, orphan `section_offsets` keys
 *
 * Those are covered instead by the integrity-DELTA oracle, which records the
 * checker's own verdict per depth and asserts undo/redo restores it. Two further
 * reasons not to duplicate them: several are `Warning`, i.e. states the app
 * considers repairable rather than corrupt, and the ref checks are largely
 * unobservable from this payload anyway - `ProjectIpc` emits merges, closures
 * and datums through `filter_map(..._to_wire)`, so a dangling ref is DROPPED on
 * the way out rather than shown.
 *
 * What is left, and what this suite asserts, is well-formedness nothing else
 * checks: id uniqueness, id-allocator dominance, and agreement between the
 * model and the derived arrays computed from it.
 *
 * Keep this dependency-free - it is injected into the webview verbatim.
