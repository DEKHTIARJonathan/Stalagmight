/**
 * The fuzzable-action allowlist, from both directions.
 *
 * `runStep` dispatches by NAME (`store.getState()[req.action]`), and on a
 * replay that name comes out of a trace file. The allowlist is what stops a
 * crafted trace calling `loadProject` or `saveProject` on a path of its
 * choosing inside a privileged webview - and it is only useful if it also
 * COVERS everything the generators legitimately produce, or the first honest
 * repro of a newly added action dies at the boundary instead of reproducing.
 *
 * Reading the generator sources rather than importing them is deliberate:
 * `undoRedoFuzzActions.ts` and `undoPersistenceCoverage.ts` build their actions
 * inside closures that need a live `ScenarioContext`, so the names cannot be
 * enumerated by calling them. The regex is anchored to the `action: '...'`
 * literal both files use for every generator.
