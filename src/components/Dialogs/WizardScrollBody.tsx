/**
 * The Connection Wizard's scrolling body: a map/settings band one viewport tall,
 * with the shot table full width beneath it.
 *
 * Scrolling down therefore carries the map and the settings up and out of the
 * way, leaving the table the whole dialog - which it could not get while it was
 * a child of the right-hand column, boxed into that column's width.
 *
 * There is ONE scrollbar: the band is a MINIMUM of one viewport rather than
 * exactly one, so tall settings make it grow instead of scrolling inside
 * themselves. The map is pinned to the top of the band while that happens, so it
 * stays useful while the settings are read, and scrolls away with the band once
 * the table arrives.
 *
 * The measurement is still needed: the band's minimum and the table's height
 * both come from the scroller's own height, so one wheel-scroll moves cleanly
 * from one to the other at any window size, and the table's grid needs a
 * definite pixel height for virtualization regardless.
 *
 * Its own component (like `WizardMapPanel`) because the wizard renders this
 * shape twice and sits far past the file-size ratchet's hard budget - it may
 * shrink but never grow, so anything added there has to leave as a component.
