/**
 * The dialog's station domain must match the payload's.
 *
 * `buildZeroDatumSectionConfig` drops blank new rows before serializing. The
 * dialog counted them, so inserting a blank row before the chosen zero-datum
 * station left the picker, the preview and the re-anchor one ahead of the
 * backend - and the GPS anchor was written to a different station than the one
 * the user selected. These pin the shared predicate both sides now use.
