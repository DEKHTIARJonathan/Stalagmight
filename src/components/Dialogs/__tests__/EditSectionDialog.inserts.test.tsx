/**
 * Where the Edit Section dialog puts the rows it creates on Save.
 *
 * The dialog edits a LOCAL copy of the section and diffs it on Save, and its
 * create call passed no position at all - so a row inserted between two measured
 * shots (right-click "Insert N shots above/below", or the keyboard insert) was
 * written after the last shot instead. The passage came back rearranged from a
 * save that looked like it had only added a leg.
 *
 * These tests pin the anchoring rule rather than the call: every added row is
 * created before the next SAVED shot, so a run of consecutive added rows keeps
 * its on-screen order without the dialog having to thread the id the backend
 * mints for each one back into the next call.
 *
 * `.tsx` so vitest runs it under jsdom - the module under test is a component.
