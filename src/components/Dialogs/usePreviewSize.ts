/**
 * Measures the wizard's map column and returns the preview size that FILLS it.
 *
 * Was `usePreviewSquareSize`, which returned the side of the largest square that
 * fit (#93). The square is what made the divider's upper range useless: the side
 * had to be the smaller of the two axes, so once the column was wider than the
 * band was tall, every extra pixel of column became dead space either side of a
 * centred square - on a 1024x640 window nothing past ~500px bought any map, yet
 * the divider still dragged to 900 (#567 item 1).
 *
 * The square was never a renderer requirement. `SectionPreview` is a MapLibre
 * viewport that fits its bounds with padding taken from its container's own
 * clientWidth and clientHeight independently (SectionPreview.tsx), so a
 * non-square viewport is drawn correctly - it just shows more cave. The only
 * square assumption was the single `size` prop, which now takes an optional
 * `height` beside it.
 *
 * Its own module because `DmpNewImportDialog` is far past the file-size ratchet's
 * hard budget - anything that can leave, must.
