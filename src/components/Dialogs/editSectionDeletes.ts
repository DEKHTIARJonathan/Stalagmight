/**
 * Where a set of shots sits in the section it is being deleted from.

 * downstream stations shift - which is why that path asks the user first.
 *
 * Kept pure and React-free so the rule is unit-testable, and because the same
 * question gets asked of one shot and of a whole selection: a run of shots at the
 * end is exactly as safe to truncate as the single last one, and answering it per
 * shot in a loop cannot work - each call would judge the others as still present.
