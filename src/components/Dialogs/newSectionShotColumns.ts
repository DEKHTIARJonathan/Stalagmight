 * GridColumn<Shot> factory for the new-section dialog's shots grid.

 * than a parallel set: headers, formatting, locale-aware `parse`, `validate`,
 * the N/J/R kind cycle and the multiline comment editor then have exactly one
 * definition, so a shot typed into the dialog and the same shot edited later in
 * the data table behave identically.
 *
 * Two knobs make it fit: `sectionId: null` (there is no section yet), which also
 * short-circuits the frozen-shot check in `editableUnlessFrozenGeometry` so
 * every column is editable, and dropping the three columns that have nothing to
 * say about an uncommitted row.
