 *
 * Dropping wholly blank new rows from the payloads created two pictures of a
 * section: the one on screen, which counts a blank row, and the one sent to the
 * backend, which does not. Every place that turns a station the user PICKED into
 * a station the backend will see had to be updated to the second picture, and
 * three were missed - zero-datum reanchoring and both DMP placement paths - each
 * capable of landing a GPS anchor or a merge point on the wrong station.
 *
 * So the predicate lives here, with the two translations that depend on it, and
 * both payload builders and index maths import them. A site that needs to count
 * shots should reach for one of these rather than write `!s.isDeleted` again.
