/**
 * Pure hit-probe geometry for the survey layer's candidate-section gate (#mem).
 *
 * The dedicated `survey-shots-hitbox` / `survey-stations-hitbox` layers were
 * removed to reclaim two full duplicate vertex buckets. Hit-testing now queries
 * the VISIBLE shots/stations layers, whose rendered mark is far thinner than the
 * old hitboxes, with a padded probe box that restores the exact old tolerance.
 *
 * This module isolates the tolerance-preservation arithmetic so it can be unit
 * tested without a live MapLibre map. See `SurveyLayer.hitCandidateSections`.
 *
 * Reach model (matches MapLibre's point-in-feature test):
 *   - a point hits a LINE within `line-width / 2` of its centerline,
 *   - a point hits a CIRCLE within its `radius`.
 * So the removed hitboxes gave reach = `hit_area / 2` (shot line of width
 * `hit_area`) and reach = `hit_area` (station circle of radius `hit_area`).
 * A box padded by `pad` around the probe reaches `pad + visibleHalf` px along
 * each axis; setting `pad = reach - visibleHalf` restores that axis reach
 * exactly. The square box reaches farther on the diagonals (a strictly larger
 * candidate set), which the SoA resolver trims back with exact math, so no
 * candidate is lost and none leaks past tolerance.
