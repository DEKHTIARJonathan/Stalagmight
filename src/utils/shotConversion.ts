/**
 * Re-render a DMP section from the shot table's current rows.
 *
 * The wizard previews are fed `DmpSection`s but the user edits `EditableShot`s,
 * so every preview that must reflect pending edits converts back. Doing that in
 * one place matters for more than duplication: `SectionPreview` draws
 * `shots.filter(s => s.shot_type === 'Standard')` and numbers the stations it
 * draws from 0, so a preview built off the RAW section addresses a different
 * station space than the shot table does. `convertToEditableShots` drops
 * non-Standard shots AND length-1 Standard ones (`isImportableDmpShot`), and the
 * table then drops whatever the user deleted. Emitting every surviving row as
 * `Standard` makes that filter a no-op, so a click on the preview and a pick in
 * the station dropdown mean the same station.
 *
 * Callers that also track a name/direction edit should spread those over the
 * result; this only rewrites the geometry.
 *
 * The rows are the EMITTED ones (`isEmittedShot`), i.e. the same set the import
 * payloads serialize. Keeping a wholly blank row here put a NaN length and NaN
 * azimuths into the preview: `computeStationsFromDmpShots` carried that NaN into
 * every station after it, so the centerline vanished and `fitBounds` was handed
 * NaNs - and the preview drew one station more than the import would create, so
 * a click on it committed a station index one past the one meant.
