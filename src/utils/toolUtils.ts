 * MapCanvas and had drifted: two still named tools that no longer exist
 * (`draw`, `delete`, `move_section`) and they disagreed on `merge`
 * (`cell` vs `crosshair`) and on the move tools (`move` vs `default`). Any
 * writer that guesses wrong re-opens the class of bug where one cursor writer
 * silently clobbers another's.
 *
 * This is the tool's resting cursor only. Two things legitimately outrank it,
 * and both live with the code that knows about them, not here:
 * - a hovered feature's `pointer`, and Move Station/Shot's arrow fallback
 *   (`SurveyLayer.refreshHoverCursor`);
 * - the Ctrl-held pan `grab` (`MapCanvas`, which owns the Ctrl state).
 *
 * The switch is exhaustive over `ToolType`: adding a tool without giving it a
 * cursor is a compile error, not a silently blank canvas.
