# Agent harness

An LLM-agent harness for driving the **real** running Stalagmight app: testing,
stress testing, bug discovery, and plain interactive use. An MCP stdio server
owns a persistent WebdriverIO session against the Tauri debug binary (headless
Xvfb on Linux), exposing tools for clicking, typing, screenshots, store-state
reads, IPC invokes, stress scenarios, and a problem sweep. Every tool call is
recorded to a JSONL action log that a generator turns into a runnable WDIO
replay spec and a repro report.

For the agent-facing workflow, see the `app-harness` skill
(`.claude/skills/app-harness/SKILL.md`). This document is the reference.

## Runtime requirement: Node 22

The harness must run under the repo-pinned **Node 22** (`.nvmrc`). WebdriverIO
9's HTTP layer fails on Node 23+ with `UND_ERR_INVALID_ARG` at `POST /session`
(a bundled-undici vs built-in-fetch mismatch). `app_start` warns early and
rethrows that error with guidance. Use `nvm use` (or corepack's pinned Node)
before starting the server.

## Architecture

```
MCP client --stdio--> e2e/agent/mcp/server.ts  (tsx, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
                        |- AppSession (e2e/agent/session.ts): state machine + command mutex
                        |    |- Xvfb (only if no DISPLAY)
                        |    |- tauri-driver --port 4544 --native-port 5544
                        |    |    -> WebKitWebDriver -> stalagmight debug binary
                        |    |       (isolated HOME/XDG, STALAGMIGHT_TEST_HOOKS=1, RUST_BACKTRACE=1)
                        |    |- webdriverio remote() ('wdio:enforceWebDriverClassic': true)
                        |- Oracles (cheap sweep per mutating action; full sweep on demand)
                        |- Recorder -> .agent-artifacts/sessions/<id>/
                             actions.jsonl, screenshots/, state/, findings/, pids, tauri-driver.log
```

All WebDriver traffic is serialized through a per-session command mutex, so a
sweep never interleaves with a tool call. The session is stateless at the tool
boundary (fresh element resolution every call) to survive WebKit stale-ref
hazards over long runs.

## Setup

- MCP config: `.mcp.json` registers server `stalagmight-app`
  (`pnpm exec tsx e2e/agent/mcp/server.ts`). In Claude Code, `/mcp` shows it.
- Direct scripts (all Node 22):
  - `pnpm agent:smoke` - session-core smoke (build -> launch -> drive -> stop).
  - `pnpm agent:mcp:smoke` - MCP-layer smoke (spawns the server, round-trips
    every tool through the protocol, self-tests the crash oracle).
  - `pnpm agent:scenarios` - runs all 8 stress scenarios once at small n.
  - `pnpm agent:mcp` - run the server standalone (for an external MCP client).

## Tools

Lifecycle:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app_start(build?, headed?, freshProfile?)` | Build if stale, launch, attach, verify hooks. `build`: auto/skip/force. |
| `app_stop` | Close app + driver, reap the process group. |
| `app_restart(freshProfile?=false)` | Restart keeping the profile (persisted-state repros). |
| `app_status` | Liveness: state, uptime, driverAlive, sessionDir, node. |

Observation:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `screenshot(name?)` | PNG as MCP image + saved to the session dir. |
| `store_state(store, path?, maxBytes?)` | Read a Zustand store; no path = key/type summary, dot path = value (JSON-capped). |
| `logs(level?, peek?)` | New ring lines since last read (error/warn/all); `peek` does not advance. |
| `wait_for(condition, ...)` | selector / hidden / app-ready / ui-idle / map-idle / active-tool / store-path. |

Interaction (each runs a cheap oracle sweep after; findings ride the result under `oracle`):

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `click(testid\|selector\|x+y, button?, double?, modifiers?)` | Fresh element resolution, waitForClickable, or a canvas pointer at coords. |
| `type_text(text, testid?/selector?, clear?, submit?)` | Focus + type; `Control` not `Meta`. |
| `press_keys(keys[])` | WebDriver key sequence. |
| `store_action(store, action, args?)` | Call a Zustand action (async-aware). |
| `eval(script, args?)` | Async function body in the webview; returns its value. |
| `ipc(command, args?)` | `window.__TAURI__.core.invoke`; e.g. `get_recent_logs_since`, `check_project_integrity`. |
| `map_view(set?)` | Read or set the MapLibre view (center/zoom/bearing). |
| `map_click(lngLat, button?)` | Geo point -> `map.project()` -> canvas-relative pointer. |
| `seed(mode, name?, projectName?)` | Open a fixture / fractal fixture (`e2e/fixtures/`), or create a basic empty project. |
| `driver_script(script, timeoutMs?)` | Node-context async body with `browser`/`ipc`/`evalInApp`/`readStore`/`callAction`/`log` in scope, under the mutex, for tight loops (one MCP call per action is too slow). |

Oracles + scenarios:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check_problems` | Full oracle sweep (see below). |
| `run_scenario(name, seed?, iterations?)` | Run a named stress scenario, then a full sweep. |

## Oracles

- **Cheap sweep** (auto after every mutating tool): crash-marker glob (fatal
  even if the process survived), React error-boundary probe, new error/warn ring
  lines since an internal cursor. A `dropped`/`ring-overflow` warning means the
  500-entry ring rotated past the cursor.
- **Full sweep** (`check_problems`): cheap sweep plus `check_project_integrity`
  (`save_blocked` = fatal, non-empty messages = error), leftover `*.stalx.tmp`
  beside `projectStore.projectPath`, `get_memory_stats` vs a session baseline
  (total RSS > baseline*1.5 + 300MB = warning, with per-process breakdown), and
  a read-only responsiveness probe (a hung IPC = possible command-lock deadlock,
  fatal).

Findings are deduped by kind+message. The first fatal/error occurrence captures
a screenshot + `finding.json` + any crash markers into `findings/<n>/` and emits
a `finding` event to the action log. Severity ranks: `warning` < `error` <
`fatal`.

## Observability hooks (app-side)

Added under a small, always-safe surface:

- **Ring buffer** (`src-tauri/src/logging/mod.rs`): `VecDeque<RingLogEntry>`
  (`{seq, ts_ms, line}`), cap 500. `get_recent_logs_since(after_seq)` returns
  `{entries, latest_seq, dropped}` where `dropped` is true when the ring rotated
  past the checkpoint.
- **Rust panic hook** (`src-tauri/src/logging/panic_hook.rs`): writes a
  synchronous crash-marker JSON `crash-<pid>-<millis>.json` into the log
  directory (message, location, thread, `Backtrace::force_capture()`) and logs
  `PANIC: ...` to the ring. The marker is the durable signal (the file log layer
  can drop tail lines on abort). A thread panic leaves the app alive but the
  marker is fatal regardless.
- **Frontend global error capture** (`src/utils/globalErrorCapture.ts`):
  `window` `error` / `unhandledrejection` -> `console.error` with the
  `[unhandled-error]` / `[unhandled-rejection]` prefixes (the oracle contract),
  rides the console bridge into the ring, rate-limited.
- **Self-test command** (`src-tauri/src/commands/debug.rs`):
  `debug_trigger_panic(delay_ms)` panics on a spawned thread (app survives; hook
  fires). Inert unless `STALAGMIGHT_TEST_HOOKS=1` (the session sets it). This is
  the harness doctor primitive.

## Action-log JSONL contract (v1)

```jsonc
{"type":"session-start","v":1,"sessionId":"...","gitHead":"...","binaryPath":"...","display":":89","headed":false,"profileDir":"...","freshProfile":true}
{"type":"action","v":1,"seq":12,"ts":"...","tool":"click","params":{...},"resolved":{"selector":"...","point":{"x":412,"y":333}},"outcome":{"ok":true,"durationMs":184},"result":{...},"artifacts":{"screenshot":"screenshots/0012-shot.png"},"post":{"view":"single","dialog":null,"activeTool":"select","projectName":"...","projectOpen":true}}
{"type":"event","v":1,"seq":40,"ts":"...","event":"finding|crash-detected|scenario-log","detail":{...}}
{"type":"session-end","v":1,"ts":"...","reason":"app_stop","actions":57}
```

`resolved` carries the concrete selector/coords the replay generator needs;
`eval`/`ipc`/`store_action` embed their full script/command/args. Generators
tolerate a truncated final line.

## Replay + report

- **Replay**: `node scripts/generate-replay.mjs <sessionDir> [--out f] [--name n]
  [--assert-final]`. Interaction tools become real WDIO code using `resolved`;
  observation tools become numbered comments; inter-action gaps > 250ms become
  bounded pauses; `--assert-final` turns the last `store_state` into a hard
  expect. Run via `REPLAY_SPEC=<file> pnpm test:e2e:replay` (spreads the base
  wdio config; single instance, no retries). Curated replays live under
  `e2e/agent/replays/`.
- **Report**: `node scripts/generate-repro-report.mjs <sessionDir>` ->
  `report.md` (steps, environment, oracle findings, evidence paths), with
  `$HOME`/session paths scrubbed for public issues.

## Artifacts layout

```
.agent-artifacts/sessions/<yyyymmdd-hhmmss-rand>/
  actions.jsonl        # the action log (JSONL contract above)
  screenshots/         # <seq>-<name>.png
  state/               # state snapshots
  findings/<n>/        # finding.json + screenshot.png + crash markers
  pids                 # recorded PIDs (for scoped orphan reaping)
  tauri-driver.log     # continuous driver stderr/stdout
  replay.spec.ts       # if a replay was generated here
  report.md            # if a report was generated here
```

Gitignored; the 20 newest sessions are kept.

## Troubleshooting

- `app_start` fails `UND_ERR_INVALID_ARG` -> you are on Node 23+; use Node 22.
- `window.__E2E_TEST__ not present` -> the binary was built without `VITE_E2E=1`;
  rerun `app_start` with `build: "force"`.
- No display -> the session starts Xvfb automatically; pass `headed: true` only
  when a real `DISPLAY` is available.
- Orphan `tauri-driver` / `WebKitWebDriver` after an unclean server kill -> the
  next `app_start` scoped-reaps PIDs recorded in each session's `pids` file
  (verified by `/proc/<pid>/comm`); it never broadly `pkill`s.
- Second instance -> set `STALAGMIGHT_AGENT_BASE_PORT` to move the driver/native
  ports (default 4544 / 5544, probed +1 up to +10).
