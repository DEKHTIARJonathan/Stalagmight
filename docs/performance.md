# Performance

This document covers key algorithmic decisions and their performance
characteristics, for both the Rust backend and the WebGL frontend.

## Loop Closure Adjustment - Sparse PCG Solver

**File:** `src-tauri/src/models/project.rs`, `adjust_least_squares()`

The loop closure adjustment solves a weighted least-squares system to distribute
survey errors across the network. The normal equations form a weighted graph
Laplacian matrix - each edge (shot) contributes a constraint between two station
groups, with weights derived from measurement uncertainties (sigma for length and
azimuth, scaled by section quality).

### Problem structure

The normal matrix A^T A is:
- **Symmetric positive-definite** (graph Laplacian)
- **Extremely sparse** - at most ~3 non-zeros per row (each station group
  connects to a small number of neighbors via shots)
- **Dimension n** = number of unknown station groups (groups connected via
  merges and aligned closures)

X and Y axes are solved independently since they have different per-shot weights
(the azimuth orientation affects directional uncertainty differently).

### Algorithm: Jacobi-preconditioned Conjugate Gradient

Instead of assembling a dense n×n matrix and using LU decomposition (O(n³)), the
solver uses a sparse representation and iterative Conjugate Gradient:

1. **Sparse assembly:** diagonal entries in `diag_x[i]` / `diag_y[i]`,
   off-diagonal entries in adjacency list `adj[i] = [(j, w_x, w_y), ...]`.
   A `macro_rules! add_sparse!` macro handles the fixed/unknown group indexing
   to avoid borrow issues with mutable arrays.

2. **Sparse matrix-vector product** (`spmv`): iterates diagonal + adjacency
   list - O(nnz) per call.

3. **Jacobi preconditioner:** M = diag(A), trivially inverted. Good enough for
   graph Laplacians where the diagonal dominance ensures fast convergence.

4. **CG iteration:** converges in O(diameter) iterations for graph Laplacians,
   which is typically much less than n.

**Complexity:** O(nnz × iterations) ≈ O(n × diameter), vs O(n³) for dense LU.

**Tolerance:** 1e-12 relative residual norm, max 10,000 iterations.

### Why not a direct sparse solver?

A sparse Cholesky (LDL^T) factorization would also work and give exact results
in one pass. However:
- It requires a sparse matrix library (e.g., `sprs`, `cholmod` bindings) - an
  extra dependency.
- The graph Laplacian structure makes CG converge extremely fast (typically
  under 50 iterations for survey networks), so the iterative approach is both
  simpler and fast enough.
- The PCG implementation is ~50 lines of pure Rust with no dependencies beyond
  `std`.

### Profiling results

On a project with ~500 sections (~10,000 stations):
- **Before (dense LU):** `adjust_least_squares` consumed 96.78% of CPU for
  multiple minutes. The inner loop was a Gaussian elimination kernel
  (movsd/mulsd/subsd) operating on a dense n×n matrix.
- **After (sparse PCG):** `adjust_least_squares` dropped to 5.14% of CPU. The
  hotspots shifted to normal app activity (image resizing, tile rendering).

## Frozen Shot Detection - Tarjan's Bridge-Finding

**File:** `src-tauri/src/models/project.rs`, `compute_frozen_shots()`

A shot is "frozen" (its geometry cannot be edited) when removing it would not
disconnect any zero datum station from the rest of the network. Equivalently: a
shot is frozen when both its endpoints can reach a zero datum via alternative
paths (shots, merges, and aligned closures) that don't include the shot itself.

### Why this matters for performance

`compute_frozen_shots()` is called on every `get_project_state()` IPC call,
including after every undo/redo operation. It must be fast.

### Previous approach: per-shot BFS

The original `is_shot_frozen()` ran two BFS traversals per shot - one from each
endpoint - to check if both sides can still reach a datum station when the shot
is excluded. With S shots and V stations:

**Complexity:** O(S × V) - for 500 sections with ~20 shots each, this means
~20,000 BFS operations, each visiting up to V stations.

### Current approach: Tarjan's bridge detection

The key insight is that frozen/non-frozen status is determined by the graph's
**bridge** structure:

- **Non-bridge shot** in a component with ≥1 datum: **frozen**. Removing a
  non-bridge edge doesn't disconnect the graph, so both endpoints can still
  reach the datum.
- **Bridge shot**: **frozen only if both sides have datums**. Removing a bridge
  splits the component into two parts; both parts must independently contain a
  datum for both endpoints to be anchored.
- **Any shot** in a component with 0 datums: **not frozen**.

The algorithm:

1. **Index stations** into compact integers for array-based access.
2. **Build adjacency list** with edge metadata (is_shot, section_id, shot_index)
   from shots, merges, and aligned closures.
3. **Iterative Tarjan's DFS** (avoids stack overflow on large graphs):
   - Computes discovery times (`disc`) and low-link values (`low`)
   - An edge parent→child is a bridge iff `low[child] > disc[parent]`
   - Simultaneously counts datums in each DFS subtree (`subtree_datums`)
   - Tracks total datums per connected component (`component_datums`)
4. **Classify each shot:**
   - Look up whether the shot's edge is a bridge
   - Non-bridge + component has datums → frozen
   - Bridge + both sides have datums → frozen
   - Otherwise → not frozen

**Complexity:** O(V + E) - a single DFS pass over the entire graph.

### Multigraph note

The DFS uses a `parent_edge_skipped` flag to correctly handle the first back-
edge to the DFS parent (skip it as the tree edge) vs subsequent edges (treat as
back edges that prevent bridging). However, in practice the survey graph is a
**simple graph**: shots connect consecutive intra-section stations, merges
connect inter-section stations, and closures connect non-adjacent stations.
No two edge types can create parallel edges between the same station pair, so
the multigraph handling is purely defensive.

### Profiling results

On a project with ~500 sections, undo operations that previously stalled due to
`compute_frozen_shots()` dominating CPU no longer show the function in profiling
hotspots.

## Per-Command Geometry Reconcile

Every command whose `command_integrity` profile sets `affects_geometry` runs a
`reconcile_geometry()` pass in the `execute()` epilogue (`check_merge_alignment`
+ `realign_merges` + `resolve_offsets`). That pass is O(total shots + total
merges) and allocates two whole-project maps (`section_local_coords` and the
resolved station offsets) - it is **not** cached between calls.

`UpdateShot` is in this group (a length/azimuth/depth edit moves stations, and
the bespoke `realign_after_shot_edit` no-ops on a merge group with no zero
datum, so without the reconcile a shot edit upstream of a datum-less merge would
leave the partners drifted). The cost is one O(N) pass **per discrete edit** -
acceptable because the Edit Shot dialog commits a single `UpdateShot` on save,
not one per keystroke, and it matches the per-command cost every other geometry
command (`MergeStations`, `MoveStation`, `SetZeroDatum`, …) already pays.

Watch this if a future bulk/Excel-style data-entry surface (see roadmap #61)
fires an `UpdateShot` per cell: that would multiply the reconcile by the edit
count and should batch the edits (the `Batch` command already finalizes once)
or debounce the reconcile.

## Profiling Guide

### Build for profiling

The project has a `[profile.profiling]` in `Cargo.toml` that inherits from
release with debug symbols preserved:

```toml
[profile.profiling]
inherits = "release"
strip = false
debug = 1
```

Build with:
```bash
cargo build --profile profiling --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

The binary is at `src-tauri/target/profiling/stalagmight` (setting `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
moves it to `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/profiling/`).

### Recording with perf

```bash
# Start the app
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 /path/to/profiling/stalagmight &

# Record (replace PID and duration)
perf record -g -p <PID> -o /tmp/perf.data -- sleep 15

# Or with DWARF call graphs for better stack traces
perf record -g --call-graph dwarf -p <PID> -o /tmp/perf.data -- sleep 120
```

### Analyzing

```bash
# Top functions by overhead
perf report -i /tmp/perf.data --no-children --percent-limit 1

# Source annotation for a specific function
perf annotate -i /tmp/perf.data --symbol=<function_name>
```

### Debug build caveat

Never profile a debug build for performance analysis. `nalgebra` and other
numerical code runs 20-50x slower without optimizations due to bounds checks
and lack of inlining/SIMD. Always use the `profiling` profile.

## Frontend - Survey Rendering Performance

The survey is drawn by custom WebGL2 layers (MapLibre `CustomLayerInterface`)
under `src/components/Map/surveyLayer/customRender/`, not by MapLibre style
layers. There is no stock-layer fallback: if a custom layer cannot start or
self-disables mid-render, it is removed and the failure latches for the session.

[`map-renderer.md`](map-renderer.md) owns the internals - tessellation, shaders,
the anchor-relative coordinate scheme, colors, labels, hit-testing, failure
paths. This section is only about where the time goes and how to measure it.

### Per frame vs per data change

**Per frame** the geometry layer (`customRender/surveyCustomLayer.ts`,
`render()`) composes the anchor matrix in float64, sets blend state, and issues
**two `drawElements` calls** - one for every shot, one for every station -
regardless of survey size. No CPU-side geometry work, no per-feature iteration,
no expression evaluation. Labels, the measure-path tint, and the drag ghost are
separate layers with their own draws.

Consequences worth exploiting:

- Show/hide toggles for shots, stations, reference legs, and jumps are shader
  uniforms. They cost a flag flip plus `triggerRepaint`, never a rebuild.
- Selection, hover, dimming, and drag-hide are per-vertex float flags with their
  own re-upload paths, so they do not disturb colors and colors do not disturb
  them.
- The one extra per-frame call is `gl.getError()` after the draws, and only for
  the first 5 frames (`MAX_CHECKED_FRAMES`) - a `getError` is a synchronous
  pipeline stall, so the layer stops asking once it has drawn cleanly.

**Per data change** `SurveyLayer.flushUpdate` runs synchronously in the same
frame: no worker, no tile cut. It rebuilds the hit index (a fresh
`SurveyGeometryIndex`, never mutated in place), syncs the geometry and label
controllers, and re-publishes the small stock overlays. `SurveyCustomController
.sync` then picks the cheapest of three tiers - incremental, color-only, full
build - with the gates in `customRender/incremental.ts`.

### What is expensive

**A full rebuild** reprojects every station, tessellates every shot, resolves
every color, packs, and uploads. The two fast paths exist to avoid it, so the
question that matters is what makes them bail. From `incremental.ts`:

| Trigger | Why the fast paths cannot bound it |
|---|---|
| Structural edit (insert / delete / merge / split / reorder, and their undos) | vertex slots move, so a per-section re-emit lands in the wrong range |
| An edit that moves the survey bbox extent | the mercator anchor shifts, so every anchor-relative position changes |
| GPS-origin change | same, via reprojection |
| Issue-severity coloring active | severity arrays are recomputed per flush and severity is non-local |
| Move-comment tint active | per-feature comment ownership is not tracked by the diff |
| More than half the sections dirty | many `bufferSubData` calls lose to one rebuild (`incremental.ts:197`) |

Everything else takes a fast path: an edit that leaves the SoA layout byte-stable
re-emits only the dirty sections' vertex ranges, and a pure global recolor
(analytical overlay enter/exit or recompute, theme swap, depth toggle)
re-resolves and re-uploads only the four color buffers, skipping reprojection and
tessellation entirely.

**Label builds** (`customRender/labelController.ts`) do glyph shaping plus a
zoom-ladder greedy declutter, which is the heaviest CPU pass in the renderer.
They are scoped to a padded viewport and emit a slack zoom window, and they
rebuild on camera settle (`moveend` / `zoomend`, coalesced and deferred off the
render stack) only when that padded viewport is exited or the slack runs out. A
modest zoom-in inside the slack window needs no rebuild.

**Hit-testing** runs per pointer move through
`SurveyLayer.hitCandidateSections`, since `queryRenderedFeatures` returns nothing
from a custom layer. `surveyLayer/geometryIndex.ts` caches projected section
AABBs against a camera snapshot, so a static hover reprojects once per camera
rather than once per probe. Every camera change invalidates that cache.

**React re-renders** of `MapCanvas` are still the reason cursor-tracking feedback
does not go through the store. Update the layer directly, keep a ref
(`snappedStationRef`) for the hot-path comparison, and defer the Zustand write
with `startTransition` so click handlers still see the right state.

### The `setData` / `setFeatureState` trap

MapLibre's `setData()` drops **all** `setFeatureState` on that source. When the
survey rode vector-tile sources, the distance overlay re-applied its per-feature
state from the per-hover visual-state update; that is a measured frame-rate
collapse, fixed in `88ec311d` ("perf(map): stop reapplying distance feature-state
on hover", #34).

The current design removes the hazard rather than managing it. There is **no
`setFeatureState` call left anywhere in `src/`**: survey geometry carries hover,
selection, and dimming as per-vertex attributes, and the few surviving stock
GeoJSON overlays (the interact overlay, the gas route, loop closures) carry their
gradient value as a feature *property* - `['get', 'dist']` / `['get', 'gasReach']`
through the same ramp expressions the bulk layers used
(`utils/distanceGradient.ts`, `utils/gasReach.ts`), so a `setData` cannot wipe
it. Several comments still say `setFeatureState`; they are stale.

The rule that survives, and that any new overlay must follow:

- **Re-push per-item overlay state in the post-rebuild tail of `flushUpdate`**,
  which is exactly what it does - invalidate `lastInteractKey`, refresh the
  interact overlay, re-apply its paint inputs, and re-push the stored gas-route
  legs.
- **Never recompute it per hover.** The per-hover path (`updateVisualState` ->
  `refreshInteractOverlay`) is deliberately bounded: a handful of features, and
  short-circuited when the composed state key is unchanged.
- If you reintroduce `setFeatureState` on any source, both halves of that rule
  apply again verbatim.

Two stock-layer patterns also still hold. Paint transitions must be zeroed on
interactive layers (`'circle-opacity-transition': { duration: 0, delay: 0 }`) -
MapLibre's 300 ms default transition reads as lag on hover feedback. And pointer
moves are rAF-batched, so only the latest event is processed per frame.

### How to profile the frontend

**Dev stats overlay** (`src/components/Map/MapDevStats.tsx`, toggled from the
Display menu) is the primary tool and the only view inside a custom layer, since
MapLibre's own instrumentation cannot see in. It wraps `drawArrays` /
`drawElements` on the context to count draw calls and triangles per frame, and
shows FPS and frame time, last-zoom average FPS and worst frame, layer and source
counts, WebGL renderer and limits, and tile-cache stats. Its per-source feature
counts call `querySourceFeatures`, which is expensive, so they are collected on
`idle` with a 500 ms throttle and never on `render`.

**Dev-only build timings.** `controller.ts` logs `[customRender] build` with
elapsed ms, shot-segment and station counts, and buffer megabytes;
`labelController.ts` logs `[customRender] label build` with the same plus
per-phase splits. Both go through `utils/debugLog.ts`, which compiles to a no-op
unless `import.meta.env.DEV` - so they appear under `./scripts/dev.sh` and not in
a packaged build. Use these rather than a stopwatch: they attribute a slow edit to
a specific tier and give the buffer size that drove it.

**Ungated lifecycle logs.** `[customRender] enabled`, `first frame drawn OK`, and
the self-disable warnings are plain `console.info` / `console.warn` on purpose,
so a production build stays diagnosable.

**Other gates.** Hit-detection tracing is config-gated
(`debug.map.log_hit_detection`); the macOS pan/zoom toolkit is gated on
`VITE_DEBUG_MACOS_LOCKUP`. Both are documented in
[`debug-gates.md`](debug-gates.md).

**`src/hooks/useFpsMonitor.ts` is not running.** It implements a rolling
`requestAnimationFrame` average with hysteresis thresholds, but it has no
consumer; the live FPS readout is `MapDevStats`' own loop. Do not wire adaptive
work to it without wiring the hook up first.
