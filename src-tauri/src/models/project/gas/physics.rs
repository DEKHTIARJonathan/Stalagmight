//! `super::tests`. Canonical SI throughout: depth in metres (positive-down), RMV in
//! L/min, pressure in bar, gas volume in litres. These are plain `f64` functions; the
//! finite/positive guards live in the `model` constructors (RMV, cylinders) and in
//! `GasConfig::normalize` (speeds/multipliers), so callers pass validated inputs (mirrors the
//! `Coordinates::new` / `new_checked` split).
