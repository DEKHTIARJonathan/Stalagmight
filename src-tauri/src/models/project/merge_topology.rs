//! The project's station merges plus the merge-only section adjacency derived
//! from them.
//!
//! The adjacency map turns the per-BFS-step scan over every merge (O(N) inner)
//! into a HashMap lookup (O(1) inner), which is what keeps
//! [`Project::get_merged_section_ids`](crate::models::Project::get_merged_section_ids)
//! linear on a large import instead of quadratic. It used to live on `Project`
//! as a plain field under an informal "rebuild it after you mutate
//! `station_merges`" contract - and a path that rewrote merge endpoints in
//! place (`Project::map_station_refs`, run by the delete-shot section split)
//! quietly broke that contract, leaving the double-anchor guard reading a
//! pre-split merge graph.
//!
//! So the map is not a field anyone can forget to refresh: it is a memo owned
//! by this type, reachable only through [`MergeTopology::adjacency`], and every
//! mutator here either invalidates it or applies its own O(1) delta. There is
//! no `DerefMut` and no way to get a `&mut Vec<StationMerge>`, so a mutation
//! that bypasses the invalidation cannot be written.
