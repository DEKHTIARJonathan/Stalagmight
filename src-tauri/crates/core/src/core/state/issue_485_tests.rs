//! [#485] A save must not drop the user's "Ignore" acknowledgements because the
//! connection it reads them through never ran the v8 migration.
//!
//! `save_project` snapshots `resolved_warnings` off the live handle
//! (`project_io.rs`, "carry resolved warnings across save") and re-applies it to
//! the fresh `.stalx.tmp` it renames into place. If that read fails, the save
//! continues with an EMPTY carry-over and every ignore is gone from the file -
//! the whole table is rebuilt from the snapshot, so a failed read is silent
//! data loss, not log noise.
//!
//! All data here is synthetic: a project built in memory, saved by this build,
//! then hand-narrowed to the pre-v8 shape. No fixture is read or written.
