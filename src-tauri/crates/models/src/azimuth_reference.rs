//! Which north a section's stored azimuths are measured against (#438).
//!
//! The contract this file exists to hold: **a stored azimuth is the azimuth that
//! was measured**. No importer rotates a reading into some internal convention,
//! and nothing writes a declination back into a shot. Instead each section
//! declares how its readings relate to true north, and geometry adds that
//! constant when it computes - once per shot, at compute time.
//!
//! That is Ariane's model (its files carry measured azimuths plus a
//! `useMagneticAzimuth` flag and it derives the declination itself), and it is
//! the one that honours the project's no-mutation-of-original-data policy.
//!
//! Two directions, and both are needed:
//!
//! * [`AzimuthReference::to_true`] - measured -> world bearing. Every geometry
//!   walk (coordinates, closure solve, move/split) reads through it.
//! * [`AzimuthReference::to_measured`] - world bearing -> measured. Every path
//!   that solves a displacement and writes an azimuth BACK onto a shot has to
//!   use it, or the section creeps by one correction per adjustment.
