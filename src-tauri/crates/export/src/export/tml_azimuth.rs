/// How this document declares its azimuths (#438).
///
/// The flag `useMagneticAzimuth` is file-level and the project's references are
/// per section, so the three answers are: the sections agree on magnetic (write
/// the readings, flag true), they agree on true north (write them, flag false),
/// or they disagree - and then the only honest single-flag document is one where
/// every bearing has been rotated into true north on the way out.
///
/// ## An UNKNOWN correction is not a competing declaration
///
/// [`CorrectionSource::Unknown`] means "no correction is on record", not "a
/// correction of exactly zero" - it is what a `.dmp` and a georeference-less
/// `.tml` get, because the device is a compass and nothing in the file says how
/// far off north it read. A section like that is raw magnetic, which is exactly
/// what `useMagneticAzimuth=true` says, so it constrains the document to be
/// magnetic and otherwise votes on nothing.
///
/// Counting it as "correction 0" instead made the common case mixed: import an
/// IGRF-corrected `.tml` alongside `.dmp` files from the same cave and every
/// bearing in the export would be rewritten and the file declared true north -
/// baking OUR zero into the `.dmp` sections permanently, and asserting about
/// them the one thing we know is false. Handing Ariane the readings and letting
/// it apply its own declination is both the honest document and the stable one.
